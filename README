=== OVERVIEW ===
gb-la is a library for reducing matrices coming Groebner bases.
Its core functionality is the special Gaussian Elimination of
structured hybrid sparse-dense matrices due to Faugère and Lachartre.



=== DEBUGGING ===
In order to debug gb one needs to use
libtool e gdb --args ./gb-la --options
since we build the library using libtool and link it than against the binary gb.
